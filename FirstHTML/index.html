    <span>The order of the planets in the solar system, starting nearest the sun and working outward is the following: </span>
    <br>
    <span>Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and then the possible Planet Nine.</span>
    <br><br>
    <span>The solar system extends from the sun, called Sol by the ancient Romans, and goes past the four inner planets,</span> 
    <br>
    <span> through the asteroid belt to the four gas giants and on to the disk-shaped Kuiper Belt and far beyond to the teardrop-shaped heliopause.</span>
